# Lasso-Regression

Lasso is a modification of linear regression, where the model is penalized for the sum of absolute values of the weights. Thus, the absolute values of weight will be (in general) reduced, and many will tend to be zeros. It provides greater prediction accuracy as compared to other regression models. Lasso Regularization helps to increase model interpretation. <br>

This repository contains the implemenation of Lasso Regression in both, Python and R.
